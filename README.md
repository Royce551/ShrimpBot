**Commands**
- For a full list of commands, run [prefix]help.
- See [link goes here eventually] for a list of console commands

---
**Running ShrimpBot yourself**
- Clone and build ShrimpBot
- Attempt to run ShrimpBot. It will create an empty configuration file and then crash.
- Head to the newly created config file in the Configuration folder and edit it as you see fit.
- Attempt to run ShrimpBot again. If you put in a valid token, it should now start!
- You may also want to set yourself as the bot owner so that you can use the bot management commands. In the console window, type `setbotowner`, and then enter your user ID.
- You might also want to set other people as bot administrators so that they can use bot management commands. In the console window, type `setbotadministrator` and enter their user ID.
- You should close ShrimpBot from now on with the `quit` command so that the database can close cleanly and running timers can be saved.
