**Commands**
- For a full list of commands, run [prefix]help.
- See [link goes here eventually] for a list of terminal commands

---
**Running ShrimpBot yourself**
- Clone and build ShrimpBot
- Attempt to run ShrimpBot. It will fail.
- Go to the newly created Configuration folder and edit the config file as you see fit. Keep the token a secret!
- Attempt to run ShrimpBot again, assuming you put in a valid token, it should run!
- You may also want to set yourself as the bot owner. Type `setbotowner`, and then enter your user ID.
- You should close ShrimpBot from now on with the `exit` command so that the database can close cleanly. If you don't, though, nothing bad will happen.
